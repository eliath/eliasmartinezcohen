==================

A personal website.

This is the old eliath.biz website, operating from 2015 - 2018.

The new website code now lives in a private repo, not on github.

### Running

To build, `cd src/` and run `grunt build`.  
Then, to view in a browser, `cd ../www` and `http-server` (if you have that tool installed).

**Note:**
The git might be missing all the images and whatnot, so the specifically the projects section may not display correctly.
