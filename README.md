###Description
This is my personal website, not really sure why it has a public git, but whatever.

###Directions
To build, `cd src/` and run `grunt build`.  
Then, to view in a browser, `cd ../www` and `http-server` (if you have that tool installed).

######Note:
The git is missing all the images and whatnot, so it really won't be any good if you pull directly from repo.
